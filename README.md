# ALDE
Active Learning-assisted Directed Evolution (ALDE) is a package for simulating and performing active learning on combinatorial site-saturation libraries for protein engineering.

## Installation
To download, clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/jsunn-y/ALDE.git
```
To run ALDE, the relevant anaconda environment can be installed from `alde.yml`. To build this environment, run
```
cd ./ALDE
conda env create -f alde.yml
conda activate ALDE
```

## Production Runs
ALDE can be executed using the following command:
```
python execute_production.py
```

## Simulation Runs
To reproduce the computational simulations on complete landscapes:
```
python execute_simulation.py
```
## Tuning the execution script.
We reccomend running the scripts with default parameters to reproduce to results from our study. However, the following variables can be tuned in the execution script.

| Variable| Default Value | Description | 
|:-----------|:-------:|:----------------:|
| encoding | GB1_onehot |defines the design objective: the encoding for the protein, and the dataset and labels to use | 
| batch size | 96 | number of samples to query in each round of active learning |
| n_pseudorand_init | 96 | number of initial random samples | 
| path | results/5x96_simulations/ | path to save results |
| runs | 70 | number of times to repeat the simulation from random initialization |
| index | 0 | index of the first run, which determines which seeds are used from rndseed.txt |
| kernel | RBF | the kernel for models with GPs, only supports radial basis function (RBF) |
| mtype | DNN_ENSEMBLE | model tpye: supports one of 'BOOSTING_ENSEMBLE', 'GP_BOTORCH', 'DNN_ENSEMBLE', and 'DKL_BOTORCH,' which is an ensemble of boosting models, a Gaussian process, an ensemble of neural networks, and a deep kernel, respectively|
| acq_fn | GREEDY | acquisition function: supports of 'GREEDY', 'UCB', and 'TS,' which are greedy, upper confidence bound, and thompson sampling, respectively|
| lr | 0.001 | learning rate, which affects the training of all models except 'BOOSTING_ENSEMBLE' |
| num_simult_jobs | 1 | number of simulations to perform simultaneously, for multiprocessing |
| arc | [encoding_dim, 30, 30, 1] | archiecture of the model, where the first element is the encoding dimension, middle elements are hidden layer sizes, and the final layer is size 1 |
| fname |  | filename for saving results, autogenerated |
| xi | 4 | $\xi$ term, only applies to upper confidence bound |
| dropout | 0 | training dropout rate |
| mcdrouput | 0 | test time dropout rate, not currently supported  |
| train_iter | 300 | number of iterations for training, which affects the training of all models except 'BOOSTING_ENSEMBLE'  |
| verbose | 2 | how much to report to the terminal  |
